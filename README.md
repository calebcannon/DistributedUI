Distributed UI Framework
========================

This framework is intended to allow developers to easily create applications that can spread their user interfaces 
across multiple iOS and MacOS devices.  The framework is designed to allow a nearly seamless development pattern
in which user input events and states are propogated over the network connection using ordinary outlet and accessor
methods.  The framework exposes additional simplified functionality for distributed computing by sharing data 
across the network interface.


Integrating into the Application

* Design components in such a way as to facilitate UI extensions.  E.g., inspector windows and tool palettes

* Integrate the framework
	* Initialization

* Establish a connection
	* Client - Server
	* Changing the Server
